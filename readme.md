## CIL Project 21: Road Segmentation

This repository contains all our code. The main branch contains only the files provided on kaggle. If you want to implement something (for example a second baseline), you can:

- clone the repository
- from the main branch, create a new branch (for example `baseline-II`)

This ensures that we always have a clean starting point
