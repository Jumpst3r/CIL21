# Training data

To get the final kaggle score, we extended the dataset to include cropped images from the deepglobe dataset. Due to the large file size, we decided to not directly include it here. To retrain submission models, you can download the extended dataset from

And extract it to mimic the directory structure of the other subfolders of this project.
